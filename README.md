I've heard this from Dhoni. The vaguely recalled version is

    You need to state the obvious and basic explicitly when you're managing a team.

This micro blog can be applied to team management and how we as individuals can deal with people. The focus will primarily be on the later.
What is Stupidity?

An individual alone can never be regarded as stupid. It's a relative term. Stupids are a conception by the non-self. Humans like to categorise people by attaching labels to them such as introverts, extroverts, short-tempered, stupid, etc. By categorisation our approach to them is hugely varied. We do this as a hack to surf the daily situations. If looked objectively it's a well known activity most of do with a poor rationale: judging people.

When asked a question, there are no stupid answers. a There are only informed, uninformed, misinformed answers. No stupid answers. Because the res-ponder doesn't perceive it as a stupid. To him it's a quite sensible answer.

Instead of labelling responses as stupid, excellent. A more rational approach would be as in a.
